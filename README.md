# SE_Single_script


This is a single script to install the SE tools the same on all labs.

Based on Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04, but should work on other Ubuntu versions. 

Option B - sets up all the dependencies and installs base services and requires a reboots (twice) ( sub script B and E). \
Option T - Installs the tools like BigRed, and Pentools.


### To run directly off Github run the following command.
```
wget -O SEtools.sh  https://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@raw.githubusercontent.com/tdmakepeace/SE_Single_script/refs/heads/main/SEtools.sh?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACUSPJE6R3QOMNIDD23SBYN6ZX6NLUQ && sleep 1 && chmod +x SEtools.sh  &&  ./SEtools.sh
```
Command valid till jan 25, then i need to update the key.

You should re run the command above for script updates as well, but you can run it locally.
